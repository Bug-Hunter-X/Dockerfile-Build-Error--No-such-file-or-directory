This repository demonstrates a common Dockerfile error and its solution. The original Dockerfile fails to build because it references a "requirements.txt" file that either doesn't exist in the correct location or has a typo in the name. The solution involves ensuring the requirements file exists in the same directory as the Dockerfile, and verifying that the file path in the Dockerfile correctly references the file.
